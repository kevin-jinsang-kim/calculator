<!--
The creation of the simple calculator requires buttons to be created in HTML.
The function of the calculator should be to perform functions with numbers.
The input is via mouseclick only, and requires no keyboard input.

!HTML!

The HTML section of the calculator is divided into rows, each containing numbers and functions.


!CSS!
The CSS will be responsible for the design of the calculator.
Font and CSS can be imported if required.
Colors are set as $ at start of code and labeled.
Body, html is width 100% to facilitate background.

Calculator class as .calculator with width, height, bgcolor and margin
with edges curved. Design is to be personal.

#### All the classes and id below are part of calculator ####

Input box (number screen) has input[type='text'] with personalised design.
The class .row displays the buttons in the HTML.
The .ctrl and .tall are for the AC, CE and + buttons.


!!!JavaScript!!!
1. Entries should be an array. Create a variable entries which is an array.

2. The variable "total" should = 0

3. A variable "temp" will have a "" value and will store temporary numbers.

4. Create a jQuery based click which has a function() when clicked.
4b. The function will encompass the number pressing, temp storing and calculating.

5. For the function of the click, a variable "val" is set with a jQuery of
$(this).text() <-- This local variable is equal to the value clicked on.

#edit: $("#answer").val() is used when you want to know what a user filled
out for an input.

6. The calculator requires to have a temporary field to store the numbers
while we function two numbers. That temporary function will only store
a value if it is a number key pressed (floats (".") and function keys don't require
the numbers to go away into a temp)

6b. The calculator will display a maximum of 10 digits.

7. Symbols other than = should add temp to entry then add current Symbol
and then clear team (for the next number)

8. The button AC should clear everything and make entries = [], temp = '' and total = 0

9. the CE button should only clear the temp value to an empty string.

10. x button should push temp and then push * and the new temp is ''
    This makes sure that the x button causes * to happen, not x. It should
    then clear the temp value to "".

11. As per the x button, the divide symbol should push /, not the symbol.

12. If the button pressed is =, the argument of temp require to be pushed
  into entries.
12a. A variable ("nt") is created to change the entries[0] into a number using
the built in function Number() to change it into a number.
12b. a loop is run which goes through all the arrays of the entries.
12c. the var i starts at 1 as the variable in 9a is at array [0] and will always
be a number for our calculator.
12d. therefore, the symbol will be entry [i] and the next number will again
use the Number() and be entries[i+1]

13. if() conditionals are used to identify the symbols (+, -, /, *) outlied
in step 9d which will take array positions [i], and the variable "nt" will
perform the function of the symbol { nt += nextNum; } and then the loop will i++.

14. We need to create an if statement which returns a negative number if <thead>
value of the variable set in 9a is < 0 using the Math.abs(9a) + '-';

15. jQuery of $("#answer").val(nt); is used to push the value of nt to <thead>
  answer id.

16. else { the number is pushed entries.push(temp); entries.push(val); temp = "";
